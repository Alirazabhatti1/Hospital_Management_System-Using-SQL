🏥**Hospital Management System (Database Project)**

🌟**Overview**

Welcome to the **Hospital Management System** (HMS) project! This is a **PostgreSQL**-based database system created to manage patient data efficiently, focusing on core operations such as Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD). Using pgAdmin 4, I developed a clean and robust relational database that enables easy patient management and data optimization for healthcare settings.

🔧 **Key Features**
**Patient Data Management:** 
Efficient tracking and managing of essential patient details (e.g., Name, Age, Contact, Medical History).
**CRUD Operations:** Full CRUD functionality to allow seamless data management.
**Data Integrity:** Carefully implemented constraints and operations for maintaining high data integrity.
**Optimized Database:** Query optimizations for fast and efficient data access.

⚙️ **Technologies Used**
**pgAdmin 4:** PostgreSQL database management tool used for managing the database.
**PostgreSQL:** Powerful relational database used to store, manage, and query patient data.
**SQL:** Core language used for creating tables, inserting, updating, and deleting data.

📝 **Project Steps**
**1. Installation of pgAdmin 4**
✔️ Set up pgAdmin 4 to interact with PostgreSQL for easy database management and manipulation.

**2. Database Creation**
✔️ Created a **Hospital Management System** database via SQL commands.

**3. Table Creation**
✔️ Designed the **Patients** table with columns for patient identification, medical history, and other essential data.

**4. Data Insertion**
✔️ Inserted patient records to populate the table and test the functionality of the system.

**5. Data Update**
✔️ Updated patient information, including modifying names and other personal details.

**6. Data Deletion**
✔️ Deleted patient records as part of data management and cleanup.

**7. Multiple Entries Insertion**
✔️ Inserted multiple records simultaneously, demonstrating the database’s capacity for batch processing.
